# Ground Rules

* What is each team's contact info, that the rest of the team can use to reach the members of the team?
> * Tyler Baum: (724) 762-2980
> * Ricky Garcia: (505) 974-8259
> * Justin Kelly: (931) 581-8808
> * John Jaramillo: (505) 264-4175
> * Slack is to be the primary method of communication between the group. Text messaging is the preferred back-up if Slack is unavailable for whatever reason. Phone calls are to be used only as an emergency measure.
> * Everyone on the team has expressed generally open availability until the end of the boot camp, with the exception of Ricky, who is unavailable between 12:15 and 12:45 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
* What are the core practices that you will use to coordinate your work as a team?
> * We have elected to use SCRUM to coordinate our work. We will perform weekly sprints with our assigned tasks, and meet at 7:45 am every weekday for a morning stand-up. We will also meet every Tuesday and Thursday evening between 7:30 and 8:30 pm, and for 2-hour blocks every Saturday or Sunday to set up the next week's sprints.
> * Most coordination throughout the week will be done in Slack, with Zoom calls for stand-ups and the evening and weekend meetings, as well as for additional meetings as needed.
* How will development tasks be chosen/assigned/accepted?
> We intend to allow everyone to volunteer for tasks they would like to do as often as possible, but will also keep a record of tasks performed, and try to ensure that everyone in the group has not only an even distribution of the workload, but also a balanced distribution of frontend and backend tasks so that we are all able to gain experience in both.
* What practices do you intend to use for resolution of conflicts?
> * In the event that a personal dispute comes up, the conflicting parties will speak privately and try to resolve disputes on their own as the first action taken. If they are unable to settle the dispute amicably, the issue will be escalated to the group for further consideration. If the group is also unable to settle the dispute, it will be escalated to the instructors as a last resort.
> * In the event of a group dispute, we will attempt to settle the dispute using a democratic process. In the event of a tie (being the sole team of four), or in the event that the result of the vote is unsatisfactory for any reason, it will be escalated to the instructors for advice in resolving the conflict.
